# Cia Builder Script

As many people have issues converting their homebrews I looked at a simple cia converter from .3dsx and found one
but it was deleted, so I remade the script. This is not for making redirections to .3dsx, it's for building directly the
homebrew .cia. 

Just double click the CIABUILDER.bat with the .elf, .rfs, banner.png and icon.png and this will automatically make the .cia
for you.
