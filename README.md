# Cia Builder Script

As many people have issues converting their homebrews I looked for a simple cia converter from .3dsx. Ifound one
but it was deleted, so I remade the script. This is not for making redirections to .3dsx, it's for building directly the
homebrew .cia. 

Just double click the CIABUILDER.bat with the .elf, .rfs, banner.png and icon.png and this will automatically make the .cia
for you.

Open the .bat file with Sublime Text or other Text editor and change the "CreatorName" and "GameName" with your names :)
